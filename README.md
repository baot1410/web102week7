## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The API request limit expired frequently which made creating the website a burden/tedious. I went ahead and made some same dataset as to what the API had initially gave from the first iteration of the this project (part 1).
So the data is not entirely fetched but is mostly hardcoded due to the limit struggle with the api request.
